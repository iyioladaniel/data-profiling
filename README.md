# data-profiling
Carry out data profiling using the pandas profiling package on dummy data generated with faker.

You can view the report inline but you have to install the ipywidgets package. I didn't install it so I exported the profiling report as a HTML file and review using Chrome.

This is convenient for me as I would be using a python script and not jupyter notebook.
